This is a repo for the homework3 of Computational Physics: solving the Burger equation

## Introduction
In this homework we aim to solve the nonlinear partial differential equation

$$
\left\{\begin{aligned}
u_{t}+u u_{x} &=0, & & x \in \mathbb{R}, & t>0 \\
u(x, 0) &=u_{0}(x), & & x \in \mathbb{R}
\end{aligned}\right.
$$

This is also well-known as the inviscid Burgers equation.
